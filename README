Multitouch MIDI keyboard in a Harmonic Table-like layout using Python and Kivy

This should work on any platform supported by Kivy/PyGame.
I use it on an 11.6" Windows 8 touchscreen laptop/tablet hybrid running Linux.

F11 will make it fullscreen, Escape quits, and pressing the tilde key (`)
will let you select an output device or program. I use Linux MultiMedia
Studio with the SoundFont player and sometimes ZynAddSubFX,
but any synthesizer that speaks MIDI should work just as well.

There are a few extra options in the tidle menu you may find useful -
for example, the number of rows and keys per row can be increased for larger
touchscreens. There are also some less useful options, but I'll leave it to
you to find or ignore them.

MasterGrid was inspired by several different Rob Fielding apps,
including CSharpAttempt (similar to his Mugician/Cantor iOS apps)
as well as by somewhat similar Android apps, such as IsoKeys/Hexiano.
This is not a continuous/legato instrument, but I may eventually attempt
to implement MIDI pitch bend for it.

Parts of MasterGrid - namely, most MIDI-related functions - are heavily based
on code from IcarusTouch (http://github.com/stocyr/IcarusTouch),
which is also licensed under the GPLv3, copyright (c) 2011 Cyril Stoller.

Please share, hack away and release any modifications you might make
if you find this useful.
