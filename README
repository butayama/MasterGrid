Multitouch MIDI Harmonic Table instrument powered by Python and Kivy

# Usage:

MasterGrid should run on almost any platform supported by Kivy with multitouch.
The MIDI output code uses PyGame, which does not work on Android or iOS.
I use MasterGrid on an 11.6" laptop/tablet hybrid which dual-boots Linux.

Pressing Space will make the window fullscreen, Escape will close the window,
and pressing Tab will open the settings, where you can select a MIDI output.
Try Linux MultiMedia Studio with the SoundFont player or ZynAddSubFX
Any synthesizer that speaks MIDI, hardware or software, should work as well.

The number of rows and keys per row can be increased for larger touchscreens.
You can change the layout slightly by shifting each row by an arbitrary number
of semitones - 5 by default, for an approximation of a Harmonic Table layout.

This is not a continuous/legato instrument, but I plan to eventually
implement MIDI pitch bend to approximate a continuous instrument.
Also on my to-do list is pressure-controlled velocity sensitivity.

# Credits:

MasterGrid was inspired by several different Rob Fielding apps,
particularly CSharpAttempt (similar to his Mugician/Cantor iOS apps)
as well as by somewhat similar Android apps, such as IsoKeys/Hexiano.

Portions of MasterGrid are heavily based on IcarusTouch
(http://github.com/stocyr/IcarusTouch) - namely, a lot of MIDI handling code.

Due to this, MasterGrid also falls under the terms of the GPLv3 or later.
